# Scaling Laws For Scalable Oversight

This repo contains the code to reproduce the plots for our paper [Scaling Laws For Scalable Oversight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18530
).



## Reproducing each figure

Below are instructions to reproduce each figure (aspirationally). 

### Requirements


The required python packages to run this repo are
```
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
dotenv
tqdm
```
We recommend you create a new python venv and install these packages, e.g.
```
python -m venv scaling
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas dotenv tqdm
source scaling/bin/activate
```
Let us know if anything does not work with this environment!


### Mafia
```
cd mafia
./script.sh
```

### Debate

```
cd debate
./script.sh
```

### Backdoor Code


### Wargames

Wargames plots can be created by running
```
cd wargames
# You can run ./run_many_ai_control.sh many times to get more samples, though note that the script itself runs each game in parallel many times
./run_many_ai_control.sh 
./run_analyze_strategies.sh
python3 analyze_ai_control.py
python3 analyze_strategies.py
```

### Combined Plots

Combined plots could be generated by running ```elo/all_analysis.ipynb```.

### Theory

All theory plots can be plotted by running:

```
cd theory
./experiment_with_optimal_strat.sh
python3 plot_theory.py
python3 git.py
```
